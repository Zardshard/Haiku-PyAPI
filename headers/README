This folder contains copies of some of Haiku's header files from versions of Haiku after
R1B4.

Currently, we need this so that we can reference some structs that were named
after R1B4 was released. Wes hould be able to delete this folder once R1B5 is
released, as the named structs will be included in the default header files
that come with R1B5.
